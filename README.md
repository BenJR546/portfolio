## Usage

- This page is very easily navigated, with the links in the navbar taking you to that section of the page.
- You can quickly return to the top of the page either with the home button or the text in the top left, which will eventually become an avatar when I have completed it
- The first image is linked to my Week 1 project

## Responsive Design
Several changes have been made to the layout of the page if it is viewed on a smaller screen (specifically less that 768px). They include:
- Changing the navbar into "hamburger" menu to minimize screen clutter
- Changing the grid layout to only be one column

## Dev Notes
This is very much a prototype of what I inted the final product to look like. It is full of placeholders which will be replaced with real content as I can fill it.
